/* 1. Write program that displays name and address
   2. Program that asks for distance in furlongs and converts it to yards (1 furlong = 220 yards)
   3. Write a program that uses three user-defined functions (including main) and produces the following output:

        three blind mice     }
        see how they run     }second function called twice
        see how they run     }
   4. Program asks for user age, program displays the age in monts.
   5. call a user-defined function that takes user input temperature in celsius and returns fahrenheit. (F = 1.8 * C + 32)
