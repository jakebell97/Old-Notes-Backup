//Chapter 4 Programming Excercise 4
/*Write a program that asks the user to enter his or her first name and then last
  name, and that then constructs, stores, and displays a third string consisting of the
  user's last name followed by a comma, a space, and first name. Use string objects 
  and methods from the string header file. A sample run could look like this:
       Enter your first name: Flip
       Enter your last name: Fleming
       Here's the information in a single string: Fleming, Flip     */
