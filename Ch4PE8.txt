//Chapter 4 Programming Excercise 8
/* Do Programming Excercise 7 but use new to allocate a structure instead of declaring
   a structure variable. Also have the program request the pizza diameter before it
   requests the pizza company name.
   
   EX 7:
   William Wingate runs a pizza-analysis service. For each pizza, he needs to record 
   the following information:
       -The name of the pizza company, which can consist of more than one word
       -The diameter of the pizza
       -The weight of the pizza
   Devise a structure that can hold this information and write a program that uses a 
   structure variable of that type. The program should ask the user to enter each of the 
   preceding items of information, and then the program should display that information.
   Use cin (or its methods) and cout.
