//Preprocessors and Body 
//Things that every program needs

//First, our libraries
#include <iostream> //our number one, lets us use things like cout, cin, endl, basic arithmetic, etc...

#include <cmath> //more complicated mathematical functions such as trig and powers

#include <fstream> //allows for the use of file streams

#include <string> //strings

#include <iomanip> //allows for formatting such as setw()

#include <vector> //still need to learn from youtube c++ video
//if you want to use standard library, which is all we really know about rn, need:
using namespace std;

//any functions/structures/classes/whatever isn't main would need to be declared or written before main
void funct(int n)
{
    cout << "This is a function before main.";
}

//main body of the program, where the program starts and ends
int main()
{
    //statements;
    return 0;    //returns 0 to main, ends program.
}
