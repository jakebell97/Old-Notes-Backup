//Chapter 4 Programming Excercise 1
/*Write a C++ program that requests and displays information as shown in the
  following example of output:
      What is your first name? Betty Sue
      What is your last name? Yewe
      What letter grade do you deserve? B
      What is your age? 22
      Name: Yewe, Betty Sue
      Grade: C
      Age: 22
      
  Note that the proram should be able to accept first names that comprise more
  than one word. Also note that the program adjusts the grade downward--that is, up
  one letter. (two letters in the case of a D, no letters in the case of an F).
  
#include <iostream>

using namespace std;

int main ()
{
    const int size = 16;
    char fname[size], lname[size];
    char grade;
    int age;
    cout << "What is your first name?";
    cin.getline(fname, size);
    cout << endl << "What is your last name?";
    cin.getline(lname, size);
    cout << endl << "What letter grade do you deserve?";
    cin >> grade;
    cout << endl << "What is your age?";
    cin >> age;
    if (grade == 'D' || grade == 'd')
    {
        grade = grade + 2;
    }
    else if (grade == 'F' || grade == 'f')
    {
        grade = grade;
    }
    else
    {
        grade = grade++;

    cout << "Name: " << lname << ", " << fname << endl;
    cout << "Grade: " << grade << endl;
    cout << "Age: " << age << endl;
    return 0;
