//Chapter 5 Programming Excercises
/*  1.  Write a program that requests the user to enter two integers. The program should
        then calculate and report the sum of all the integers between and including the two
        integers. At this point, assume that the smaller integer is entered first.
       
    2.  Redo Listing 5.4 using a type array object instead of a built-in array and type
        long double instead of long long. Find the value of 100!
        
    3.  Write a program that asks the user to type in numbers. After each entry, the
        program should report the cumulative sum of the entries to date. The program should
        terminate when the user enters 0.
        
    4.  Daphne invests $100 at 10% simple interest. That is, every year, the investment earns 
        10% of the original investment, or $10 each and every year:
        
        interest = 0.10 * original balance
        
        At the same time, Cleo invests $100 at 5% compound interest. That is, interest is 5%
        of the current balance, including previous additions of interest.
        
        interest = 0.05 * current balance
        
        Cleo earns 5% of $100 the first year, giving her $105. The next year she earns 5% of
        $105, or $5.25, and so on. Write a program that finds how many years it takes for 
        the value of Cleo's investment to exceed the value of Daphne's investment and then
        displays the value of both investments at that time.
        
    5.  You sell the book C++ for Fools. Write a program that has you enter a year's worth 
        of monthly sales (in terms of number of books, not of money). The program should
        use a loop to prompt you by month, using an array of char * (or an array of 
        string objects, if you prefer) initialized to the month strings and storing the input
        data in an array of int. Then, the program should find the sum of the array
        contents and report the total sales for the year.
