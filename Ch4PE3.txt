//Chapter 4 Programming Excercise 3
/*Write a program that asks the user to enter his or her first name and then last
  name, and that then constructs, stores and displays a third string, consisting of the 
  user's last name followed by a comma, a space, and first name. Use char arrays and
  functions from the cstring header file. A sample run could look like this:
       Enter your first name: Flip
       Enter your last name: Fleming
       Here's the information in a single string: Fleming, Flip         */
